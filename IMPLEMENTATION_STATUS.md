# BDPayX Implementation Status & Roadmap

## ✅ **CRITICAL DATABASE ISSUE RESOLVED**

**PREVIOUS ERROR:** Foreign key relationships missing between request tables and user_profiles
```
Could not find a relationship between 'deposit_requests'/'withdrawal_requests'/'exchange_requests' and 'user_profiles' in the schema cache
```

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:** Manual API data joining implemented successfully
- Updated `getAllDepositRequests()` with manual profile joining
- Updated `getAllWithdrawalRequests()` with manual profile joining
- Updated `getAllExchangeRequests()` with manual profile joining
- Fixed `checkUserRole()` method to handle missing profiles gracefully
- All admin request screens now load data properly without errors

## ✅ **RESOLVED ISSUES**

### 1. **DATABASE RELATIONSHIP ERRORS** ✅ RESOLVED
**Solution implemented:** Manual API data joining
```typescript
// Implemented in getAllDepositRequests, getAllWithdrawalRequests, getAllExchangeRequests:
const requests = await supabase.from('deposit_requests').select('*');
const userIds = [...new Set(requests.map(req => req.user_id))];
const profiles = await supabase.from('user_profiles').select('*').in('user_id', userIds);
const profileMap = new Map(profiles.map(profile => [profile.user_id, profile]));
const requestsWithProfiles = requests.map(request => ({
  ...request,
  user_profile: profileMap.get(request.user_id) || null,
}));
```

### 2. **Auth Loading Issue** ✅ RESOLVED
- Fixed `checkUserRole()` method to handle missing user profiles gracefully
- Changed from `.single()` to `.limit(1)` to prevent errors on missing profiles
- Added proper fallback to 'USER' role when profiles don't exist
- Sign-in process now works smoothly without hanging
